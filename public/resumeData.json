I have worked as a software engineer in different places for six years. Mostly I used PHP frameworks such as Laravel and Codeigniter, otherwise I used Nodejs and GraphQL to build an API. I also work with C++ to develop desktop apps. In my spare time, I like to create some utility tools for my daily purposes(e.g: data visualization, web crawler, etc) using Python or Javascript. Currently, I am focused on learning React Native to develop cross-platform apps. Additionally, I'm also interested to work with Web 3.0 technology especially Blockchain (e.g: Smart contract, Bitcoin)",
